A key contribution is the development of an original orbital-free DPFT code, leveraging the PyTorch machine learning library for multi-GPU acceleration, and its release as a Python package. The code accurately implements 2D and 3D magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, with results aligning with physical expectations. Comparisons with custom Kohn-Sham DFT code and the state-of-the-art software VASP were conducted to enhance accuracy. An innovative low-pass filter on TF density improved results, suggesting future research potential.</li></ul></li><li><p><a href="/education/2020-06-30_NUS.opencert" download>Download NUS OpenCerts certificate</a></p></li><li><p>Verify the certificate at <a href="https://www.opencerts.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.opencerts.io</a></p></li></ul><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><h4 id="thesis" tabindex="-1">Thesis <a class="header-anchor" href="#thesis" aria-label="Permalink to “Thesis”">​</a></h4><ul><li><a href="/education/2020-03-01_BSc_Thesis.zip">BSc_Thesis.zip</a></li><li><a href="/education/2020-03-01_BSc_PPT.zip">BSc_PPT.zip</a></li><li><a href="/education/2020-03-01_BSc_Thesis_src_code.zip">BSc_Thesis_src_code.zip</a></li></ul>',6)),t(a,{src:"/education/2020-03-01_BSc_Thesis.pdf"}),t(a,{src:"/education/2020-03-01_BSc_PPT.pdf"}),e[1]||(e[1]=i('<h3 id="study-notes-bsc" tabindex="-1"><a href="/Study-Notes-BSc/index.html" target="_blank">Study Notes (BSc)</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#study-notes-bsc" aria-label="Permalink to “Study Notes (BSc)”">​</a></h3><p><a href="/Study-Notes-BSc/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></a></p>',2))])}const T=n(h,[["render",p]]);export{S as __pageData,T as default};
